How Augmented Reality is Changing Education
Augmented Reality (AR) as transformational technology will most probably start reshuffling
the myriad dimensions of human life in the near future. One of those impacted during that
period was education. AR essentially represents the melting of the physical and digital
world to interact with the user's surroundings in a way that never existed before. And as
education moves forward into being more digital, AR changes how students learn, and
teachers teach and how schools deliver content to make classes more engaging and
immersive.
AR has a significant influence on engagement in the classroom. Olden ways, textbooks,
lecturing, etc., are pretty archaic and do not hold the interest of all learners. With AR, it is
felt that change occurs since learning may become more interactive. For instance, in the
study of biology, a student would be able to interact with 3D models of the human body;
they could see organs up close and even rotate them. In history, for example, AR will send a
student back in time, hence making the events much more vivid and alive. There could be
the triggering of interest and motivation of students to become more actively involved in
learning if real learning spaces are infused with virtual elements.
A connection of theory to practical takes a much more meaningful approach than ever
before in AR. Sciences, engineering, and medicine all demand an application of real-world
to digest theoretical concepts. AR aids in visualizing complex ideas. Medical students can
simulate a surgery while the engineering student can dissect a mechanical system in 3D.
This makes learning more comprehensive as the students are well-prepared to apply the
knowledge in practical real-world situations.
In addition, AR enhances inclusion and access in the learning process for students with
disabilities as it adjusts content to certain needs; it can be heard in audio when the student
has no eyesight or have text overlays in case of a student who is deaf. Furthermore,
through real-time translation, AR can break all barriers of language cultures emanating
from a multicultural classroom, hence ensuring that everyone gets to learn.
Higher Retention and Comprehension
AR enables better retention and comprehension studies have illustrated. It provides the
learner with a more robust learning environment. Students will get to learn through more
senses and interact first-hand with the material in space. For instance, math students can
imagine geometrical shapes and equations of abstract concepts through AR. The result is
that they remember better in the long term and understand better.
This technology further changes the face of teaching. Traditionally, teachers are sources of
knowledge, and students are passive recipients of knowledge coming from them. Hence,
the dynamics would change with the empowering of AR wherein students can take a hold
of their learning. According to each student's level of performance, teachers can prepare
lessons which are said to make instruction more student-centered and interactive.
With the advancement of technology, it would be seen in more education institutions
operating virtual classrooms for experience and global learning. It has a great potential in
revolutionizing a domain like medicine or engineering, bringing interesting and realistic
simulations that would provide real-world exposure to students.
Summed up, though, AR is already potent in education; it adds pleasure to learning,
clearness in understanding, and practical tools toward learning the complex subject. Of
course, much more importantly, as technology progresses, effective and immersion will be
further developed in AR-augmented education so that it better equips students to face an
increasingly digital world of human activity.
